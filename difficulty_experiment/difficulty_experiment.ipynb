    "\n",
    "### Data Source\n",
    "- Student–question interactions\n",
    "- Topic-specific IRT ability scores\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experiment Steps\n",
    "1. **Create Student Dataset**: Select 50 students with broad topic coverage and extract their topic-specific IRT ability scores.\n",
    "2. **Select Questions**: Identify 10 questions with high interaction counts and stable difficulty scores.\n",
    "3. **Simulate Student Responses**: Use LLMs (via Gemini) to simulate how these students would answer the questions (including ability scores in the prompt).\n",
    "4. **Extended Experiment**: Add ability scores from foundational topics by identifying prerequisites via LLM.\n",
    "5. **Analysis**: Calculate difficulty scores from simulated answers and compare with the actual ones.\n"
