Previousinvestigationsoftheabilityofcontentexpertsandtestdeveloperstoestimateitemdifficultyhave,forthemostpart,produced
disappointing results. These investigations were based on a noncomparative method of independently rating the difficulty of items.
In this article, we argue that, by eliciting comparative judgments of difficulty, judges can more accurately estimate item difficulties.In this study, judges from different backgrounds rank ordered the difficulty of SAT®mathematics items in sets of 7 items. Results
showed that judges are reasonably successful in rank ordering several items in terms of difficulty, with little variability across judges
andcontentareas.Simulationsofapossibleimplementationofcomparativejudgmentsfordifficultyestimationshowthatitispossibleto achieve high correlations between true and estimated difficulties with relatively few comparisons. Implications of these results for
thetestdevelopmentprocessarediscussed.

In Embretson’s (1983) conceptualization of construct validity, construct representation concerns identifying the theo-
retical mechanisms (i.e., the processes, strategies, and knowledge) that underlie test performanceand, thus, support theinterpretationoftestscores.Suchrepresentationsestablishthebasisforinterpretationoftestscoresbutrequireascientificandtheoreticalfoundationforitemandtestdesignprinciples(Embretson,1998).Thatis,scientificevidenceandtheory

standing of the relevant processes guiding the test taker in arriving at a response to an item may increase the accuracyof prediction of an item’s psychometric features. Principles for test design are emerging for some item types, includingpopulartestitemssuchasparagraphcomprehension(Freedle&Kostin,1993;Gorin&Embretson,2006)andmathemat-
ical problem solving (Enright, Morley, & Sheehan, 1999; Singley & Bennett, 2002), as well as other item types on ability
tests, such as spatial items (Bejar, 1993) and nonverbal reasoning items (Embretson, 1998). Nevertheless, a much largerfoundationisneededtosupporttestmeaningfromthiskindofevidence(Embretson,2007).

thatrelyonauxiliaryitemswithknown p+asanaidintheestimationofthedifficultyofotheritems.Intheiranchor-based
method, judges first discussed attributes of easy, medium, and hard items (defined in terms of three threshold points onthep
+scale: 25%, 50%, and 75%) and were then provided with two representative items in each of the three difficulty
bands.Inonestudy ofreadingcomprehensionitems,theseanchoritems wereusedtohelpratethedifficultyof21otheritems.Theaveragecorrelationbetweentheratingsandempirical p
+was.32(Hambletonetal.,2003,Table2).Thejudges

logicalreasoningitems,andtheaveragecorrelationbetweentheratingsand p+was.61and.76fortheinitialandrevised
ratings(Hambletonetal.,2003,Table4).
The item-mapping method seems to have produced significantly better results than the anchor-based method and
conventional rating methods. This method also has more in common with comparative judgment methods than withindependent rating, because it essentially requires placing the item in an appropriate position within a presorted list,instead of independently rating its difficulty. In one early study of item difficulty judgments, Lorge and Kruglov (1953)askedexpertstorankorderthedifficultyof45arithmeticitems.Resultsofthisstudyarecomparabletotheresultsoftheitem-mappingmethod,withrankordercorrelationsthatvariedbetweenthe.50sand.80s,withanaverageofaround.70.
In this article, we argue that the main reason for the inability of experts to judge the difficulty of test items accu-
rately is the use of noncomparative methods for eliciting judgments of difficulty. With the rating task, experts are askedto provide a direct measurement of the difficulty of an item, independently of other items. Therefore, this task assumesthat the judge possesses a scale that can be used to perform this measurement. However, as Hambleton etal. (2003)argued, even experts lack a frame of reference for this kind of judgment. This lack of a mental scale means that thedifficulty of items can be best judged in comparison to the difficulty of other items. Measurement through methods ofcomparative judgment has a long history in psychology (Thurstone, 1927). The method of paired comparisons is themost flexible as a basis for scaling, but it is less efficient than rank ordering a larger set of items. In this article, we setforth to explore a comparative judgment method for item difficulty that is based on rank ordering. Rankings of itemdifficulty by test developers on a large pool of SAT
®mathematics items were collected and analyzed. Then, a simula-
tion was conducted to estimate the success of one possible method for generating difficulty judgments that are based
on item comparisons—asking judges to compare the difficulty of a new item to a series of anchor items with knowndifficulty.

Atotalof26EducationalTestingService(ETS)testdevelopersandexternal(toETS)itemwritersparticipatedinthestudy.
Participants had different backgrounds and levels of experience: six SAT test developers, five GRE®test developers, 10

Results
Rank Correlations Between Delta Values and Rater Rank Ordering
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics about the Spearman rank-order correlations between difficulty judgments and
equated delta values. Correlations were computed for each set of seven items, with a total of 32 sets (four sets in each of
eightcontentareas)perrater.Theexpectednumberofsetsis104(foursetsand26raters),butduetothemissingvalues
discussedabove,somecontentareasaremissingoneortwosets.Theoverallmediancorrelationwas.79,withasomewhat
lower average correlation of .70, due to a small number of very low correlations. Table 1 also shows some variability in
resultsacrosscontentareas(thestandarddeviationofthemediancorrelationacrosstheeightcontentareaswas.06),with
lowerresultsfortranslationsandtriangles.Interestingly,testdeveloperspredictedthatfunctionsanddataanalysiswouldbe more difficult for raters. Some variability of results also occurred across raters (not shown in Table 1); the standard

most familiar with the items and are regularly exposed to item statistics did not perform better than, for example, new
item writers who are not familiar with the items and are not exposed to item statistics. This is an important result, as it

This study focused on mathematics problem-solving items. An interesting issue for future research is the generaliz-
abilityoftheseresultstoothercontentareas,especiallydifferenttypesofverbalreasoningitems.Aspecialcomplicationarises with items that naturally appear in sets, such as reading comprehension items. For these items, it could be more
difficulttocompareitemsfromdifferentsets,and,therefore,itcouldbemoredifficulttofindanchoritemswithexisting
