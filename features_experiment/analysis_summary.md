# Question Difficulty Prediction Analysis Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes our findings from developing various models to predict question difficulty based on text embeddings and other features. We explored LightGBM tree-based models, Random Forest models, neural network architectures, and BERT-based models, with a special focus on handling very low difficulty questions and evaluating model performance without using response count features that wouldn't be available for new questions. We've also conducted extensive hyperparameter optimization to maximize LightGBM performance and experimented with different embedding models to improve semantic understanding.

## Dataset Analysis
- We worked with a dataset containing 4696 questions total
- 234 questions (approximately 5%) had very low difficulty scores (< -6)
- These very low difficulty questions had significantly fewer responses (mean of 18.68) compared to normal questions (mean of 55.44)
- The distribution of the difficulty scores showed a clear separation between very easy questions and the rest

   - Neural networks benefit more from improved embeddings than from additional engineered features
   - Deeper networks with skip connections help neural models process high-dimensional embedding data
   - Both model types benefit from proper regularization techniques

7. **Training Efficiency:**
   - Neural models can converge quickly with proper batch size and learning rate
   - Tree-based models scale better with increasing feature count
   - Subsampling training data (30% of total) provides good approximation of full dataset performance
   - Early stopping prevents overfitting in all model types
   - Our latest LightGBM model showed effective early stopping, with folds stopping between iterations 119-193

8. **Dataset Choice:**
   - The choice between questions_filtered.csv and questions_master.csv significantly impacted performance
   - Further investigation into the differences between these datasets may yield additional insights

9. **Model Architecture Comparison:**
   - LightGBM (gradient boosting) consistently outperforms Random Forest (bagging) for this regression task
   - Gradient boosting seems to better handle the high-dimensional embedding space compared to bagging
   - Random Forest tends to overfit on specific embedding dimensions rather than generalizing well

   - When advanced feature engineering is applied, the performance gap between different model types narrows significantly

10. **Basic Features vs Embeddings**:
   - A model using only basic text features and metadata achieves modest performance (R² = 0.3788)
   - Adding MPNet embeddings significantly improved performance (R² = 0.4996), a 31.9% relative improvement
   - The improvement from embeddings is comparable to the gain from advanced feature engineering
   - Lexical features (word count, character count) remain important even when embeddings are available
   - Jaccard similarity between options is a strong predictor regardless of embedding availability

## Recommendations

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Implement separate models for very easy questions and normal questions
   - For a general model, always filter out very low difficulty questions (< -6) for improved performance
   - Apply power transformations to normalize feature distributions
   - Use stratified sampling based on difficulty bins for training data
   - When possible, include auxiliary information about question responses, but ensure models can also perform well without this information

2. **Model Selection:**
   - If response count data will be available (e.g., for existing questions), filtered LightGBM models provide the best performance
   - For new questions without response data:
     - **Hyperparameter-Optimized LightGBM provides the best performance (R² = 0.5321)**
     - BERT-based models offer excellent performance (R² = 0.5300), but require more computational resources
     - DistilBERT models provide a good balance of performance (R² = 0.4990) and efficiency, requiring less computational resources than BERT
     - MPNet embeddings with even simple LightGBM models provide excellent results (R² > 0.52)
     - Neural Network models offer good performance (R² = 0.4822) and may be more robust to changes in input features
     - Random Forest models (R² = 0.4054) underperform compared to other approaches but could be easier to interpret
     - Consider computational efficiency: LightGBM offers faster inference and requires fewer resources than BERT
   - The model choice hierarchy for predictive performance appears to be:
     1. **Hyperparameter-Optimized LightGBM (highest accuracy with good efficiency)**
     2. BERT fine-tuned models (high accuracy, but computationally expensive)
     3. Enhanced LightGBM with advanced feature engineering (excellent balance of accuracy and efficiency)
     4. DistilBERT models (good performance with faster training and inference than BERT)
     5. Neural Networks with embeddings (good performance, more robust to feature changes)
     6. Random Forest with embeddings (acceptable performance, simpler implementation)
   - For highest accuracy with acceptable efficiency, an ensemble approach combining multiple models may be optimal
   - If computational efficiency is important, DistilBERT offers the best trade-off between accuracy and speed

3. **Embedding Selection:**
   - For best performance, use more powerful embedding models like all-mpnet-base-v2
   - The performance gain from better embeddings (2.7-6.2% improvement in R²) is comparable to extensive feature engineering
   - For production systems with limited resources, the smaller all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model still provides good results
   - Consider fine-tuning embedding models on domain-specific data for further improvements

4. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Continue using text embeddings as they significantly improve performance, especially when count features aren't available
   - Extract text-based features (mathematical symbols, complexity indicators) to supplement embeddings
   - Focus on most important features identified in our feature importance analysis: character count, word count, special character count, mathematical symbols
   - Apply clustering to embeddings to create categorical features that capture question similarity
   - Consider TF-IDF features to capture term importance in questions
   - Reduce embedding dimensionality using PCA to improve model efficiency without significant performance loss
   - Even without embeddings, focus on question length, option similarity, and mathematical content indicators
   - Jaccard similarity between options provides valuable signal and should be included even in simpler models

5. **Neural Network Design:**
   - Include skip/residual connections to improve gradient flow in deeper networks
   - Apply batch normalization to stabilize training
   - Use learning rate scheduling to help convergence
   - Implement early stopping to prevent overfitting
   - Consider separate pathways for processing different feature types (embeddings vs. other features)

6. **Production Implementation:**
   - For a production system, implement a two-step model:
     - First, classify questions as "very easy" (difficulty < -6) or "normal"
     - Then, apply different models based on whether response data is available:
       - If response data is available, use the filtered LightGBM model with count features
       - If no response data is available, choose based on resource constraints:
         - BERT model for highest accuracy (R² = 0.5300)
         - Enhanced LightGBM for good accuracy with faster inference (R² = 0.5231)
         - MPNet Enhanced LightGBM for excellent balance of accuracy and robustness (R² = 0.5221)
         - MPNet simple LightGBM for balanced performance and simplicity (R² = 0.5177)
         - MPNet Enhanced Neural Network for flexibility and embedding focus (R² = 0.5122)

7. **Hyperparameter Optimization:**
   - For LightGBM, focus on controlling tree depth (max_depth, num_leaves) to balance between underfitting and overfitting
   - Learning rates around 0.02-0.03 worked best for this task
   - Use bagging techniques (bagging fraction ~0.6-0.7) to improve model robustness
   - Maintain high feature fraction (~0.9-1.0) to allow the model to utilize the full range of engineered features
   - For neural networks, batch size of 64 and learning rates around 0.001 work well
   - For Random Forest, increasing the number of estimators and controlling tree depth would likely improve performance

8. **Model Architecture Comparison:**
   - LightGBM (gradient boosting) consistently outperforms Random Forest (bagging) for this regression task
   - Gradient boosting seems to better handle the high-dimensional embedding space compared to bagging
   - Random Forest tends to overfit on specific embedding dimensions rather than generalizing well
   - Neural networks show more robust performance with fewer engineered features
   - BERT's contextualized embeddings provide additional value over static embeddings
   - When advanced feature engineering is applied, the performance gap between different model types narrows significantly

9. **Further Research:**
   - Investigate why these very easy questions have fewer responses
   - Explore different embedding models to see if performance can be further improved
   - Test the models on new, unseen questions to ensure generalizability
   - Experiment with fine-tuning BERT and DistilBERT on more question data before using them for regression
   - Explore other transformer-based models (e.g., RoBERTa, DeBERTa) to see if they provide additional improvements
   - Consider ensemble methods that optimally combine predictions from different model types
   - Optimize Random Forest hyperparameters to see if performance can approach that of LightGBM

## Conclusion
Filtering out very low difficulty questions significantly improves model performance across all model types. When response count features are available, the filtered LightGBM model achieves exceptional performance with a Test R² of 0.7651. 

In the more realistic scenario where response data isn't available for new questions, we have multiple strong options:
1. **Hyperparameter-Optimized LightGBM: R² of 0.5321**
2. BERT model: R² of 0.5300
3. Enhanced LightGBM (optimized with advanced features): R² of 0.5231
4. MPNet Enhanced LightGBM (latest): R² of 0.5221
5. MPNet simple LightGBM: R² = 0.5177
6. **Extended Hyperparameter-Optimized MPNet LightGBM (100 trials): R² = 0.5131**
7. MPNet Enhanced Neural Network: R² = 0.5122
8. Basic Features + MPNet Embeddings: R² = 0.4996
9. DistilBERT model: R² of 0.4990
10. Neural Network with basic embeddings: R² = 0.4822
11. Basic Features Only (No Embeddings): R² = 0.3788
12. Random Forest with basic embeddings: R² = 0.4054

Our hyperparameter-optimized LightGBM model has achieved the best overall performance, narrowly outperforming the BERT model while maintaining faster training and inference times. This demonstrates that with careful feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning, gradient boosting models can be highly competitive with transformer models for this regression task. 

The extended hyperparameter optimization experiment with 100 trials confirmed that effective parameters can be found relatively early in the optimization process, and reinforced our understanding of the most important features for predicting question difficulty.
